We use the better tools to stay in touch and do the best.
We are working asynchronous: [Remote Work Should Be (Mostly) Asynchronous](https://hbr.org/2021/12/remote-work-should-be-mostly-asynchronous)
We support [right to disconnect](https://www.steveglaveski.com/blog/why-the-right-to-disconnect-is-a-bad-idea) — a proposed human right with respect to disconnecting from work-related electronic communication during non-work hours, something that France introduced [in 2016](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/08/telework-and-the-french-right-to-disconnect/#:~:text=In%202016%2C%20the%20French%20government,lives%20with%20calls%20and%20emails.).

## Tools we are using daily on work with project

The following tools can help leaders implement systems to influence how we work for the better.

### Task Boards

Task boards, which provide a transparent and single source of truth for the status of project tasks, give us a clear view of what our colleagues are working on when, and how much progress has been made.

Trello Asana Monday or Basecamp boards permit users to leave comments and ask questions in a way that promotes asynchronous responses instead of the real-time pull of email and instant messaging.
 
### Office Hours and Scheduling Tools

[Remote Work Should Be (Mostly) Asynchronous](https://hbr.org/2021/12/remote-work-should-be-mostly-asynchronous)

Office hours is a concept that can help to do this, popularized by Cal Newport, author of [_Deep Work_](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Cal-Newport-audiobook/dp/B0189PVAWY). Essentially, it refers to a period of time that people carve out for meetings on a daily or weekly basis. Ideally, time slots are ring-fenced to no more than 30 minutes, notwithstanding urgent or extraordinary circumstances, and are [aligned with people’s preferred work patterns](https://hbr.org/2014/06/when-to-schedule-your-most-important-work). 

For example, early birds are best advised to block out their mornings for deep work, whereas night owls are likely to do the same with their afternoons. Tools such as Calendly, x.ai, and others can facilitate booking time slots that don’t sacrifice other people’s priorities and can help to improve meeting efficacy.

### Shared Documents

Shared documents empower people to work on the same document asynchronously without bearing the burden of version control. 
Google Docs 
Dropbox Paper 
all of which support in-document annotation and team member tagging.

Visual collaboration platforms 
Miro 
Mural 
support both real-time and asynchronous whiteboarding for brainstorming and strategy work.

Sharing documents during real-time Zoom calls also ensures that important data are available for whole team.


### Instant Messaging Plugins

Plugins can help to effectively slow down apps like Slack, getting us out of a cycle of viewing and sharing tons of cat gifs and pop culture memes each day, moving us toward a more asynchronous use of instant messaging platforms.

We can escape information overload with the Must-Read plugin,

which serves up only messages that colleagues have tagged you in.

TryRoots’ AutoResponder lets other Slack users know that you’re currently away, 
when you’ll be back online, and offers a path for recourse if necessary. 

Plugins like Team Standup take the pressure off routine tasks such as daily standups and have people answer questions relating to their workload for the day by way of an automated bot, as and when it suits them.

# IDE online

Narzędzia do pracy zdalnej z edytowaniem i udostepnianiem kodu


## [CodeSandbox: Online Code Editor and IDE for Rapid Web Development](https://codesandbox.io/)

+ A sandbox needs no setup - use a template to kickstart new projects, or start from a GitHub repo and begin coding in seconds.
+ A sandbox is a superfast development environment. They’re purpose-built for rapid web development in the browser.
+ A sandbox is collaborative. Like a Google Doc but for code, you can get feedback and create together, in real-time or asynchronously.
+ A sandbox updates live, so you can see the effect of changes instantly, inline, as you code.
+ A sandbox can be shared with a click. Your friends, team, or colleagues can join in, or view your creation with just a URL.

Example:
https://codesandbox.io/s/rwzyq379jn?file=/index.html


## [JSFiddle - Code Playground](https://jsfiddle.net/)

+ edycja jak w codepen 
+ łatwa zmiana orientacji tabów
+ Collaborate - możliwość rozmawiania podczas kodowania przez mikrofon

## [Trending - CodePen](https://codepen.io/trending)

+ codepen Asset uploading manager [not free]
+ [CodePen Challenges](https://codepen.io/challenges)
Challenges are fun opportunities for leveling up your skills by building things. Each week, you’ll get a new prompt surrounding a monthly theme to riff on. The best Pens get picked and featured on the homepage!
The November #CodePenChallenge starts now!

This month's theme is text styles. Styling text is a powerful skill for front-end developers. The right style can turn a drab header into a memorable bit of branding, or transform a dull wall of text into something that is a joy to read.

Each week this November, we'll prompt you with a different text styling technique and give you a basic HTML template with some text to style. We'll give you a few of ideas for what to create and some resources to make it happen. Then it's up to you to give that text some style!

There's still time to participate in this month's challenge! A new challenge starts on the first Monday of next month.
Completed challenges

    Book Text
    Knockout Text
    Card Text
    Text Shadow
